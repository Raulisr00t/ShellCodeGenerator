## 🚀 About

**ShellcodeGenerator** is a custom tool written in **Nim** that dynamically patches IP and port values into hand-crafted x86 assembly shellcode (NASM syntax) for **Windows reverse shells**.

It compiles and links the shellcode into a PE binary (`.exe`) and extracts printable shellcode bytes suitable for exploitation tasks, malware research, or CTFs.

---

## 📦 Features

✅ Patch any IP address and port into shellcode  
✅ Fully x86 NASM compatible  
✅ Generates raw shellcode from compiled `.exe`  
✅ Written in Nim for speed and flexibility  
✅ Linux-only for ethical red teaming and malware research  
✅ Highlights correct little-endian formatting for network values

---

## ✅ Advantages

- 🔓 **Non-Signature Shellcode**  
  The generated shellcode does **not rely on common payload templates**, making it **unique on every run**. This effectively defeats most static signature-based detection techniques.

- 🛡️ **Bypasses Antivirus (AV) Engines**  
  Due to its polymorphic nature and absence of known patterns, this shellcode can evade many modern **AV and EDR solutions**, making it ideal for red team operations and stealthy post-exploitation.

- 🧬 **No External Dependencies**  
  Fully self-contained: no Metasploit, no PowerShell, no external loaders—pure, raw shellcode.

- 🎯 **Precision Targeting**  
  Configurable target IP and port are directly embedded in little-endian format at compile time, reducing runtime footprint.

## 🧪 Requirements

- Linux OS (any distro)
- [`nasm`](https://www.nasm.us/) — Netwide Assembler
- [`ld`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ld) — GNU linker
- Nim Compiler (`nim`)

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Install Nim:
```bash
sudo apt install nim
```

Install Nasm and LD 
```bash
sudo apt install nasm binutils
```

Clone The Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raulisr00t/ShellcodeGenerator.git
cd ShellcodeGenerator
```

## 🛠️ Usage
```bash
nim c -d:release generator.nim
./generator <IP> <PORT>
```

Example
```bash
./generator 192.168.0.100 4444
```

Output:
```bash
[*] Replacing IP with: 0x6400a8c0
[*] Replacing PORT with: 0x5c11
[+] Written modified assembly to root.nasm
[+] Assemble root.nasm
[+] Linking
[+] Done !
Printing Shellcode
"\x31\xc9\x89\x00\x00\x00..."
```

## 📂 File Structure
```bash
.
├── generator.nim      # Main tool logic
├── root.nasm          # Modified NASM shellcode (auto-generated)
├── reverse.exe        # Compiled shellcode payload (auto-generated)
└── README.md          # Documentation
```

## 🧠 How It Works
Assembly Template: Inline NASM with placeholders for IP and port
Patch Engine: Replaces relevant lines using regex with correct little-endian values
Shellcode Extraction: Uses objdump and shell pipelines to extract clean, printable shellcode
